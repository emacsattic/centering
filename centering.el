;;; Commentary:

;; This mode ensures that the cursor is always in the center of the
;; display. This can be useful at times if, for example, you are
;; trying to get lots of stuff onto one screen for a screenshot, or to
;; read without using the keyboard. 
;;
;; It has one major entry point which is `centering-mode' which turns
;; on a minor mode. 
;;
;; It currently works by recentering the display after the line
;; position has changed. There is a delay before this happens or the
;; constant redisplaying makes the emacs look horrible. Set
;; `centering-timer-delay' to change the length of the delay. Setting
;; it to 0 is permissible. 



;;; Todo
;;
;; Well it doesn't work. So fix the centering-recenter function. Also 
;; this should only use a single timer. When switching on, check for
;; timer, start if not. When switching off check whether there are any
;; centering buffers left open, if not kill it. 
;;
;; The current logic is imperfect, because if the a key is
;; autorepeated, then the system will not update when the up key is
;; removed. Perhaps I should move back to the old delay system.
